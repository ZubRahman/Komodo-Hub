        <div class="faq-answer" id="faq5">
            <p>Yes! You can sponsor an animal by making a specific donation that supports the care and rehabilitation of a particular species. By sponsoring, you will receive updates on the animal's progress and how your contribution is making a difference in its life.</p>

        <div class="faq-answer" id="faq7">
